# microbit-ultrasonic
Example usage of a HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor and the BBC Micro:Bit. The example will return the duration in microseconds and then convert this to a valid Inches or Centimeters value.

Change the lines below to match your Ultrasonic Echo and Ping sensor:

**Pin 0 on the Micro:Bit to the HC-SR04 Echo Pin.**
**Pin 1 on the Micro:Bot to the HC-SR04 Trigger Pin.**

**Note: The HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor is a 5v device. It needs 5v to operate, not the supplied 3v from the BBC Micro:Bit. You will need an external power source. The Trigger and Echo pin connect to the Micro:Bit.**
